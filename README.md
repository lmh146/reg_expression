# Regular Expressions

## Overview
This project uses regular expressions to find patterns in text files to then be sorted and displayed.

### reg_expression1
This script takes a text file of website requests log and searches for valid usernames to then sum the bytes each user 
has consumed. The users are then sorted in descending order and only those with greater than 1000000 bytes are displayed.

### reg_expression2
This script takes a text file of a news article that describes current stock trends and finds every instance of a stock 
being mentioned. It then sorts the ticker name by their name and displays the percentage change as well as if it is
positive or negative.
